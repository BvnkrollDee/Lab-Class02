        Hello my name is Walter Hartwell White I live at 308 Negra ORoyal lane. Nahhh I'm just kidding, my name is Daron Faulkner Jr. 
        and I am currently working on becoming a future software developer. I'm 22 years young and enjoy doing things such as
        exercising and playing video games from time to time. I've always grown up with a good sense of hard work and what it looks like.
        I know how to prioritize things and handle my business before anything else.
